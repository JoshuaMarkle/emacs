#+title: Josh's Emacs Configuration

This [[file:config.org][configuration]] is centered around *DOOM Emacs* because *Vim Motions* are awesome. This is mainly used for the day to day of a CS major.

* Current State of This Configuration ðŸš§

This configuration is in a really early and experimental state of existence and is really me exploring all of the things Emacs can do. I aim for this config to target primarily note taking and programming. This are the two main aspects of my life that I aim to optimize to their fullest.

** Current Features âœ…

- Custom Tokyo Night theme! (the best theme)
- Minimalized DOOM-Modeline with custom mode indicators
- Competative programming environment
  - Run code quickly
  - Better user input system
  - And more within the config
- Sensible defaults

** Intended Features âœ¨

I am kinda trying to recreate the Neovim experience but better

- An actually documented system for note taking, probably something Zettelkasten
- A bunch more custom UI, this is what I most enjoyed programming in Neovim
- Solid programming environment, very similar to Vim, mainly for Python & C++ (almost there)
- R/RMarkdown + Unity + Flutter + Arduino support if I can
- And many more ideas
